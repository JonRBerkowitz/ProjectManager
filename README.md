# Version
This app uses Ruby v2.5.3

# Installation
To install the app, simply run rake db:migrate, and rake db:seed if you want some test data to start with.

# What this app does
Task master is a group project management tool. A user can create a project, give it a name and a due date, and add multiple tasks. Each task can then be assigned to any user of their choosing. Please see below for a usage example.

# On Login
You will see a blank screen with no projects listed. To add a new project, simply click "New Project" in the nav bar.
